# How to better approach the book
Right now, the book tends to take larger steps than I'm comfortable with.
The code to implement certain functionality or tests seem to spring up
in various places.  It feels like a combination of _invention_ and _discovery_.
It's hard to tell how to approach the invention part without the prior experience
and heuristics.

However, it very well could be that I do not have enough experience to
see the necessary heuristics. Additionally, the confusion could be trying
to balance understanding the content of the book and listening to the
feedback from the tests.
